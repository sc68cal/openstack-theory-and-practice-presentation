# OpenStack - Theory and Practice

This talk will introduce OpenStack, a open source IaaS platform that
can be installed on your own hardware to provide compute, storage,
and network APIs similar to Amazon Web Services.

The talk will also provide a quick tour through the internals of
OpenStack,  focusing on the Compute (Nova) and Networking (Nova-network / Quantum)
services.
